\section{Chooser options under the Blachelier Model}
We consider the Blachelier model with where the stock prices $\{S_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ evolves according to 
\begin{align}
	 S_t = S_0 + \kappa W_t
\end{align}
where $S_0 > 0$ and $\{W_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ is a Brownian motion under the risk neutral measure $\tilde{\mathbb{P}}$.

We consider a contract with maturity $T$ and strike price $K$, that allows an agent to decide on a choosing date $\tau < T$ to choose the underlying derivative. Many results are known when an agent is allowed to choose between a European call and a European put. In this section we consider a contract that allows an agent to decide between two securities that pays 
\begin{align}
     C_T = (A_T - K)^+, \; P_T = (K - A_T)^+, \; A_T = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T S_t \; dt.
\end{align}
(fill in derivation that gives $V_\tau$, the value of the contract at time $\tau$).
Here, we assume the agent chooses optimally with no outside information. At time $\tau$, the agent will choose the option of higher value between the put and call. The value of contract $V$ at time $\tau$ is 
\begin{align}
     V_\tau = \max(C_\tau, P_\tau).
\end{align}
We subtract $C_\tau$ out of the max function and get
\begin{align}
     V_\tau = C_\tau + \max(0, P_\tau - C_\tau)
\end{align}
which we want to evaluate through Put-Call Parity.

Recall that Put-Call Parity tells us
\begin{align}
     P_T - C_T = K - A_T. 
\end{align}
We can replicate the LHS of the above equation by going long a put and short a call at time $0$, both with strike $T$. 
We also replicate the RHS by investing $Ke^{-rT}$ into the bank at time 0 and shorting a contract to receive $A_T$ at time $T$. 
Since both portfolios are of equal price at time $T$, they have equal price at all times $t$ where $0 \leq t \leq T$. 
At time $\tau$, the left portfolio is the value of the put minus the call at time $\tau$. 
The right portfolio now has $Ke^{-rT + r\tau}$ in the bank and is short a contract which pays $A_T$ at $T$.
Define $P_\tau$ and $C_\tau$ to be the respective values of a put and call with maturity $T$ at time $\tau$.
Let $w_\tau$ be the value of the contract at time $\tau$ to receive $A_T$ at time $T$.
By replication, our portfolios give us the following equation

\begin{align}
     P_\tau - C_\tau = Ke^{r(\tau - T)} - w_\tau.
\end{align}

So in conclusion, we find that 
\begin{align}
     V_\tau = C_\tau + \left(K- S_0 + \frac{\kappa(T-\tau)}{T} W_\tau - \frac{\kappa}{T} \int_0^\tau W_t \; dt  \right)^+.
\end{align}
Then by the risk-neutral pricing formula, the time-zero price of this contract is given by
